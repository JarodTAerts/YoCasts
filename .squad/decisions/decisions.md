# Decision Log

## Azure Function Proxy for PocketCasts API (2026-04-14)

**By:** Wash (API Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-04-14  
**Affects:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev), Mal (Lead)

### Context

Garmin Connect IQ's `Communications.makeWebRequest()` has a hard ~32-44 KB response limit (error `-402 NETWORK_RESPONSE_TOO_LARGE`). Our `/user/podcast/list` response is 43 KB for just 15 podcasts because of huge `description` and `descriptionHtml` fields the watch doesn't need.

### Decision

Created `YoCastsProxy/` — a .NET 8 isolated worker Azure Function that acts as a transparent strip-and-forward proxy between the Garmin watch and PocketCasts API.

**Key design choices:**
1. **Stateless** — no credentials stored. Bearer token comes from the watch and is forwarded.
2. **Whitelist approach for podcast list** — only 11 fields kept (uuid, title, author, etc.). This is more aggressive than blacklist but guarantees size.
3. **Catch-all route** (`/api/pocketcasts/{*path}`) — mirrors PocketCasts paths so the Garmin app just changes base URL.
4. **No caching** — keep it simple for v1. Could add Azure Cache for Redis later if needed.
5. **Anonymous auth level** — the function itself has no auth gate; PocketCasts Bearer token provides access control.
6. **Consumption tier** — scales to zero, minimal cost for personal use.

### Impact on Garmin App

Kaylee needs to:
1. Add a configurable proxy base URL (could be an app property)
2. Route data requests through the proxy instead of directly to PocketCasts
3. Keep auth requests (`/user/login_pocket_casts`, `/user/token`) going directly to PocketCasts — the proxy is only for data endpoints

### Alternatives Considered

- **Client-side field filtering in Monkey C** — not possible, the response is too large to even receive
- **Garmin companion app** — too complex, requires Android/iOS development
- **Cloudflare Worker** — viable but .NET matches our stack

## Azure Function Proxy Integration — Garmin Side (2026-04-14)

**By:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-04-14  
**Affects:** Wash (API Dev), Mal (Lead), Jarod Aerts

### Decision

Garmin app now routes all data-fetching API calls through an Azure Function proxy (`PROXY_BASE` constant in `PocketCastsPodcastService.mc`). Login and token refresh remain direct to `api.pocketcasts.com`.

### Rationale

PocketCasts API responses (especially `/user/podcast/list` with full descriptions) can exceed the CIQ ~32KB `makeWebRequest()` response limit. The proxy strips heavy fields (`description`, `descriptionHtml`, etc.) before forwarding to the watch.

### What Changed

- Added `PROXY_BASE` constant alongside existing `API_BASE` in `PocketCastsPodcastService.mc`
- `_makeAuthPost()` now uses `PROXY_BASE` for all data calls
- Removed `:maxLength => 65536` option from proxy calls (proxy guarantees small responses)
- Login (`_login()`) and token refresh (`_doTokenRefresh()`) still use `API_BASE` directly
- Class docstring updated with proxy architecture explanation

### Dependencies

- **Wash/Jarod:** Azure Function must be deployed and `PROXY_BASE` URL updated in the code before real API testing
- Proxy must forward `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header as-is
- Proxy endpoints must mirror PocketCasts API paths (e.g., `/user/podcast/list`, `/up_next/list`, `/user/episode`)

### Build Verification

Build passes `monkeyc.bat -d venu441mm -f monkey.simulator.jungle -o bin\YoCasts.prg -l 3` (strict mode, zero errors).

## AudioContentProviderApp Migration Complete — SDK Constraints & Implementation (2026-04-14)

**By:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-04-14  
**Phase:** Phase 0  
**Status:** COMPLETED

### Key Findings (SDK 9.1.0)

1. **No `Media` Permission in Manifest** — The SDK rejects `<iq:uses-permission id="Media"/>` as invalid. The Media module is implicitly available for `audio-content-provider-app` types. Only `Communications` permission is needed. Confirmed by Garmin's MonkeyMusic sample.

2. **Communications.SyncDelegate Required** — SDK 9.1.0 enforces `Null or Communications.SyncDelegate` as the return type for `getSyncDelegate()`. Media.SyncDelegate is fully deprecated at the type system level. All future sync code must extend Communications.SyncDelegate.

3. **Inlined View Construction** — The strict type checker requires AudioContentProviderApp view methods to return specific tuple types. A shared helper method returning untyped Array causes type errors. Each method (`getInitialView`, `getPlaybackConfigurationView`, `getSyncConfigurationView`) must construct views inline.

4. **SyncConfigView Deferred to Phase C** — For Phase 0, `getSyncConfigurationView()` returns HomeMenuView. A dedicated SyncConfigView with episode download selection UI will be built in Phase C.

5. **Settings Unchanged** — PocketCastsPassword uses `alphaNumeric` type (no `password` type exists in CIQ). Settings XML works identically in audio-content-provider-app.

### Files Changed
- `manifest.xml` — type changed to audio-content-provider-app
- `YoCastsApp.mc` — base class changed, 5 new methods added
- `source/media/YoCastsContentDelegate.mc` — NEW stub
- `source/media/YoCastsContentIterator.mc` — NEW stub (includes PlaybackProfile)
- `source/media/YoCastsSyncDelegate.mc` — NEW stub extending Communications.SyncDelegate
- `monkey.jungle` — added source/media to sourcePath

### Build Status
- Monkey C Compiler: PASS at `-l 3` (strict)
- All tuple returns properly typed

## Migrate to AudioContentProviderApp (2026-04-14)

**By:** Mal (Lead)  
**Date:** 2026-04-14  
**Affects:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev), Wash (API Dev)  
**Status:** APPROVED  
**Document:** `docs/app-type-migration-evaluation.md`

### Summary

YoCasts must migrate from `AppBase` (device app) to `AudioContentProviderApp` (audio content provider) to enable audio playback on Garmin. This is not optional — there is no alternative for playing audio through Bluetooth headphones on Garmin watches.

### Key Findings

1. **AudioContentProviderApp inherits from AppBase** — all View/UI code survives. Custom drawing, Menu2, WatchUi.pushView(), InputDelegate — all work identically.
2. **Migration is small** — 2 files rewritten (YoCastsApp.mc, manifest.xml), 1 new file (SyncConfigView.mc), 12+ files completely unchanged.
3. **Every successful audio app on Garmin uses this pattern** — Spotify, Deezer, Amazon Music all use AudioContentProviderApp.
4. **The manifest changes to `type="audio-content-provider-app"`** and gains a `Media` permission.
5. **NowPlayingView changes role** — from playback controller to episode info display. Garmin's native media player handles playback UI.
6. **HomeMenuView survives intact** — served from `getPlaybackConfigurationView()` instead of `getInitialView()`.

### Architecture Changes

- **App class:** `extends AppBase` → `extends AudioContentProviderApp`
- **New required methods:** `getContentDelegate()`, `getSyncDelegate()`, `getPlaybackConfigurationView()`, `getSyncConfigurationView()`, `getProviderIconInfo()`
- **New files (migration-specific):** `SyncConfigView.mc`, `StubContentDelegate.mc` (temporary)
- **Phase plan update:** New Phase 0 (1 day) prepends the existing 5-phase plan. Phases A–E unchanged.

### Risk Assessment

**Confidence: HIGH (8/10).** Confirmed via Garmin API docs, MonkeyMusic sample, developer blog, community forums, and web research. Remaining 2 points require simulator/hardware validation (Phase 0).

### Impact on Existing Decisions

- **Menu2 for all list UIs** — still valid. Menu2 works in AudioContentProviderApp.
- **No text input on watch** — still valid. Application.Properties unchanged.
- **Dictionaries, not classes** — still valid. Data model layer unchanged.
- **Cache strategy** — still valid. Application.Storage works identically.
- **Audio download elevated to Phase 3** — now ENABLED by this migration. Phase 0 is the gate.

### What This Supersedes

- `audio-download-implementation-plan.md` Task D1 (YoCastsContentProvider) — no separate ContentProvider class. App IS the provider.
- `audio-download-implementation-plan.md` manifest change listed as Phase C — now Phase 0.
- `garmin-media-and-background-research.md` Option A concern about "limited UI" — debunked. Full UI available.

## Split-Dock Home Menu Implementation (2026-04-13)

**By:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-04-13  
**Affects:** Mal (Lead), Jarod (Owner)

### What Changed

Completely rewrote `HomeMenuView.mc` to implement the split-dock design from `docs/garmin-layout-reference.md` v2.0 Section 5. The old 4-pill scrollable layout (Queue, Podcasts, Now Playing, Settings) is replaced with a two-zone design:

1. **Zone 1 (Y=0–260):** Scrollable menu with 3 adaptive-width pills (Queue, Podcasts, Settings). Pill widths computed from round screen circle geometry at each Y position. Scrolling supported for future items but not needed for 3 items (204px content fits in 220px viewport).

2. **Zone 2 (Y=260–390):** Fixed Now Playing dock showing podcast name, episode title, progress bar, time display, and play/pause icon. Dock is drawn on top of scrollable content with `dc.setClip()` clipping at Y=260.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Now Playing moved from scrollable pill to fixed dock.** This gives always-visible playback status without scrolling.
- **Removed `hitTest()` method from View** — touch zone logic moved entirely to delegate's `onTap()` with fixed Y boundaries (365+ for play/pause, 260-365 for NP screen, <260 for pill hit testing).
- **Gear icon upgraded** to 6-tooth spec from Section 5.5.6 (was 4-tooth cardinal direction).
- **3 menu items instead of 4** — Now Playing is no longer a menu pill; it's always visible in the dock.
- **Physical button index cycles 0-2** (Queue, Podcasts, Settings) instead of 0-3.

### Build Status

Build passes `monkeyc -l 3` strict with zero errors/warnings.

## Audio Download & Offline Sync Implementation Architecture (2026-04-13)

**By:** Mal (Lead)  
**Date:** 2026-04-13  
**Affects:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev), Wash (API Dev)  
**Document:** `docs/audio-download-implementation-plan.md`

### Summary

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the audio download + offline sync system — the biggest remaining technical challenge for YoCasts. Translates the design-level `offline-sync-design.md` v1.1 into step-by-step build instructions.

### Key Decisions

#### 1. Five-Phase Implementation (A → E)

| Phase | What | Depends On |
|---|---|---|
| **A: Changelog & Position Tracking** | Persist mutations locally. PositionTracker, ConnectivityManager, auth persistence. | Existing code |
| **B: Sync Engine** | Push changelog to server, pull state, reconcile conflicts. State machine with retry logic. | Phase A |
| **C: Audio Download Infrastructure** | Download manager, SyncDelegate, download manifest tracking. Battery guards. | Phase A |
| **D: Media Playback Integration** | ContentProvider, ContentIterator, ContentDelegate. Wire to position tracking. | Phase C |
| **E: Full Reconciliation & Polish** | Queue merge algorithm, storage pressure monitoring, error hardening, interface updates. | Phases B-D |

#### 2. Position Save at 15s Intervals (Adaptive)

- 15s default → 30s at 20% battery → 60s at 10% → on-pause-only at 5%
- 240 writes/hr at normal — within Garmin flash spec (100K+ cycles/cell)
- Max 15s data loss on crash — acceptable tradeoff

#### 3. Consolidated Positions Map

Replace per-episode `yc_pos_<uuid>` keys with a single `yc_positions` map. One read fetches all positions for sync. Evicts oldest clean entries at 50-entry cap.

#### 4. clearCache() Now Selective

`Application.Storage.clearValues()` is no longer safe. Changelog, auth tokens, download manifest, and sync state must survive cache clears. Switched to selective `deleteValue()`.

#### 5. App Type → audio-content-provider

`manifest.xml` changes from `type="watch-app"` to `type="audio-content-provider"`. This enables the Media module APIs. Required for downloaded audio playback.

#### 6. CachedPodcastService Bug Fix Identified

Current `_isConnected()` only checks `phoneConnected`, missing Wi-Fi-direct. Must change to `ConnectivityManager.isConnected()` which checks `connectionAvailable`. This means `fetchAll()` works over Wi-Fi without phone.

#### 7. No Download Resume in v1

Partial downloads are discarded and restarted. `makeWebRequest()` doesn't support Range headers, Media module doesn't expose partial file access. Full re-download takes seconds on Wi-Fi. Not worth the complexity.

#### 8. 64 KB Background Memory Budget

SyncDelegate gets ~15 KB after Garmin runtime overhead. Rules: no large arrays, no audio buffering in memory, minimal Dictionary allocations, sequential downloads only.

### Open Questions

1. **Exact Media download API** — `Media.ContentRef` creation and audio file storage varies by SDK version. Kaylee needs to prototype against Venu 4 simulator.
2. **Application.Storage exact limit on Venu 4** — estimated 128-256 KB. Needs hardware testing.
3. **`Communications.makeWebRequest()` for binary audio** — need to verify response handling for non-JSON content types in the context of Media storage.

### Impact

- 8 new files, 9 modified files
- manifest.xml changes require re-deployment
- IPodcastService interface expands (4 new methods)
- MockPodcastService needs corresponding stubs

## Wi-Fi Direct Connectivity Model for Offline Sync (2026-04-13)

**By:** Mal (Lead)  
**Date:** 2026-04-13  
**Affects:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev), Wash (API Dev)  
**Document:** `docs/offline-sync-design.md` v1.1

### Decision

Updated the offline sync design from a two-state connectivity model (online/offline) to a three-state model (Wi-Fi / Phone BT / Fully Offline) based on the Venu 4's Wi-Fi direct capability.

### Key Changes

1. **Three connectivity states** — Wi-Fi connected (best, no phone needed), Phone connected via Bluetooth (full API but slower), Fully offline (cache only).
2. **`connectionAvailable` is the primary check** — `System.getDeviceSettings().connectionAvailable` returns `true` for either Wi-Fi or BT proxy. This replaces `phoneConnected` as the sync trigger.
3. **Phone companion is less critical** — The watch can sync metadata, push playback state, and download episodes directly over Wi-Fi. The phone is still useful but no longer a prerequisite.
4. **Two episode download paths** — Path A: system-triggered `SyncDelegate` (charger + Wi-Fi, traditional). Path B: app-initiated (Wi-Fi detected, no charger, with battery guards).
5. **Auto-download on Wi-Fi** — When Wi-Fi connects and Up Next has un-downloaded episodes, begin downloading automatically (max 3 episodes off-charger, skip if battery < 30%).
6. **Sync state machine updated** — New DOWNLOAD? step after PULL_SERVER to trigger episode downloads when Wi-Fi is available.
7. **Phase 3 simplified** — No phone intermediary needed for episode downloads. `makeWebRequest()` over Wi-Fi handles large files at full speed.

### Rationale

The Venu 4 has Wi-Fi hardware and `Communications.makeWebRequest()` transparently uses it. This dramatically simplifies the offline architecture — the user's typical flow of "come home, watch auto-syncs and downloads over Wi-Fi" works without the phone even being nearby. This is a better UX than requiring phone proximity or charger placement for sync.

### Impact

- Kaylee: `getConnectivityState()` helper needed in Phase 1. Phase 3 implementation is simpler — no companion app dependency for downloads.
- Wash: No API changes needed. `makeWebRequest()` abstracts the transport.
- All: The phone companion app (if we ever build one) is now a nice-to-have, not a requirement.

## Audio Download API Findings (2026-04-12)

**Author:** Wash (API Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-04-12  
**Affects:** Mal (Lead), Kaylee (Garmin Dev)  
**Document:** `docs/pocketcasts-audio-download-research.md`

### Summary

Completed live-tested research on how PocketCasts serves audio and what the Garmin watch needs to do for offline downloads. Tested 7 episodes across 7 different CDN providers.

### Critical Findings

#### 1. Audio is NOT proxied by PocketCasts

Episode URLs are original RSS feed URLs. PocketCasts just passes them through. The watch/phone downloads directly from podcast host CDNs (Megaphone, Simplecast, Transistor, SupportingCast, Podbean).

#### 2. No authentication needed for audio

All 7 CDNs returned `200 OK` without any Bearer token. PocketCasts auth is only for the metadata API, not for audio file access. **The phone companion can download audio without API credentials.**

#### 3. Range requests work everywhere

All 7 CDNs support `Range: bytes=X-Y` headers with `206 Partial Content` responses. Resumable downloads are fully supported — critical for unreliable BLE connections.

#### 4. URLs redirect heavily (1-6 hops)

Every audio URL goes through analytics/tracking redirectors before reaching the CDN. HTTP client must follow redirects. The phone's HTTP stack handles this natively.

#### 5. API `size` field is unreliable

Often `"0"` (string, not number). When non-zero, doesn't match actual Content-Length (10-20% discrepancy). **Must issue HEAD request for real file size.**

#### 6. Premium feed URLs may expire

SupportingCast (Verge ad-free, etc.) URLs contain embedded JWT tokens with timestamps. A 3.3-day-old URL still worked, but expiry is likely. **Always re-fetch episode URL from API immediately before download.**

### Decisions Needed

1. **Maximum download size/count** — Episodes range from 19 MB to 243 MB. Recommend capping at 3 episodes or 200 MB total. Need Kaylee's input on Garmin Media storage limits.

2. **Download timing** — Should downloads happen during Garmin Media sync (the standard approach) or via a custom background transfer? The Media module's ContentProvider/SyncDelegate pattern is the intended mechanism.

3. **URL refresh strategy** — Given possible SupportingCast expiry, should we cache URLs for max 1 hour? Or always call `/user/episode` right before download?

### Impact on Architecture

- Mal's offline-sync-design.md Phase 3 (Audio Download) is now unblocked — all API mechanics documented
- The phone companion does all the heavy HTTP lifting (redirects, Range requests, downloads)
- Watch-side storage is through Garmin Media module, not `Application.Storage`
- Position sync after playback uses per-episode `POST /sync/update_episode` (no batch)
- `/user/in_progress` provides all data needed for bulk reconciliation

## Media Module Constraints Discovery (2026-04-13)

**From:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-04-13  
**Affects:** Mal (Lead), Wash (API Dev)  
**Urgency:** HIGH — affects core architecture

---

### Critical Constraint: App Type Must Change

**Discovery:** Audio download/playback on Garmin requires `AudioContentProviderApp` — a fundamentally different app type from our current `device` type. This is NOT a "feature we add" to our existing app. It changes the app's identity, lifecycle, entry points, and UI surface.

**Impact:**
- Our current app is a `device` type launched from the app list
- An `AudioContentProviderApp` is launched from the **music widget** only
- Different base class: `AudioContentProviderApp` instead of `AppBase`
- Different lifecycle: `getSyncConfigurationView()`, `getPlaybackConfigurationView()`, `getContentDelegate()` instead of `getInitialView()`
- Cannot have both types in a single app (unverified but strongly indicated by all documentation)

**Options for team discussion:**
1. **Convert entirely to AudioContentProviderApp** — lose app-list presence, gain full media integration
2. **Ship two apps** — device app for browsing, audio provider for playback (complex, data sharing problems)
3. **Stay as device app, no native audio** — can't reliably download or play audio

**My recommendation:** Option 1. All successful podcast/music apps on Garmin (Spotify, Deezer, Amazon Music) are AudioContentProviderApps. The sync config view can serve as our episode selection UI.

---

### SyncDelegate Deprecation

`Media.SyncDelegate` and `Media.startSync()` are deprecated after System 9. Must use `Communications.SyncDelegate` (same interface). But there may be no replacement for programmatic sync triggering — needs SDK testing.

---

### Audio Download Mechanism

- Audio downloads MUST go through SyncDelegate → `makeWebRequest()` with `HTTP_RESPONSE_CONTENT_TYPE_AUDIO`
- This bypasses the ~32-100KB response size limit by streaming to disk
- Downloads are sequential (one at a time), cannot be parallelized
- Cannot resume interrupted downloads
- OGG format NOT supported — MP3 and M4A/AAC only

---

### Background Services Cannot Trigger Audio Sync

Background `ServiceDelegate` (64KB memory) can make small HTTP requests for metadata but CANNOT:
- Access the Media module
- Trigger SyncDelegate
- Download audio files

Background services are useful for: metadata polling, position sync pushes, new episode checks.

---

### Connectivity: We CAN Distinguish Wi-Fi from Bluetooth

`System.getDeviceSettings().connectionInfo` has `:wifi` and `:bluetooth` keys with `ConnectionState` values. This means we can implement smart sync: audio over Wi-Fi only, metadata over either.

No connectivity change callbacks exist — must poll.

---

**Decision needed from Mal:** Which app type path do we take? This affects every file in the project.

## User Directive: Home Menu Redesign (2026-04-12)

**By:** Jarod Aerts (via Copilot)  
**Timestamp:** 2026-04-12T14:54:11Z

Redesign the home menu with a split layout:
1. **Bottom 1/3** = static "Now Playing" dock. Play/pause button at very bottom (rounded area), time elapsed/total + progress bar above it, podcast name + episode title above that (in the widest part of the section). Text scrolls/marquees. Tap play/pause = toggle playback, tap elsewhere = open full Now Playing screen.
2. **Upper 2/3** = scrollable section with Queue, Podcasts, Settings buttons. These scroll UNDER the Now Playing dock (dock stays fixed on top, visually).
3. **Add a Settings button** and a simple placeholder settings page for future items (playback speed, auto-download, etc.).

**Rationale:** User request — captured for team memory and layout reference

---

## PocketCasts Auth Strategy — Use Two-Token OAuth Flow (2026-04-12)

**Author:** Wash (API Dev)  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Affects:** Mal (Lead), Kaylee (Garmin Dev)

### Context

Live API testing showed `POST /user/token` returning 400 Bad Request. Investigation of 6 community PocketCasts API clients revealed the root issue: **wrong request format and wrong login endpoint**.

### Root Cause

1. We logged in via `/user/login`, which returns `{ "token": "..." }` — a simple access token with **no refresh token**
2. We sent `POST /user/token` with empty body `{}` and a `Bearer` auth header
3. The endpoint actually requires: `{ "grantType": "refresh_token", "refreshToken": "<token>" }` in JSON body, with NO Authorization header
4. The refresh token is only available from `/user/login_pocket_casts`, which returns full OAuth2-style response

### Key Discovery: Two Login Endpoints, Two Token Systems

| Endpoint | Response Fields | Refresh Capable |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| `/user/login` | `token`, `uuid`, `email` | ❌ No refresh token |
| `/user/login_pocket_casts` | `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expiresIn`, `tokenType`, `uuid`, `email` | ✅ Full OAuth2 |

### Recommended Auth Strategy

**Primary: Proactive Token Refresh**

1. Login via `POST /user/login_pocket_casts` with `{ email, password }`
2. Store `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, and `expiresIn`
3. Track expiry — before each API call, check if token is near expiry
4. Refresh proactively via `POST /user/token` with `{ "grantType": "refresh_token", "refreshToken": "<saved>" }`
5. Save new tokens — refresh response returns NEW `accessToken` AND NEW `refreshToken` (token rotation)
6. Fallback — if refresh fails with `invalid_grant`, re-login with stored credentials

### Evidence Base

All 6 community clients that implement token refresh use `/user/login_pocket_casts` + `/user/token` with `grantType`/`refreshToken` format:
- `yfhyou/api_pocketcasts` (Python, Dec 2025)
- `rudiedirkx/pocketcasts-api-client` (PHP, 2024)

Others use `/user/login` only (no refresh capability).

### Garmin-Specific Implementation

- Credentials stored in `Application.Properties` (set via Garmin Connect Mobile)
- Tokens stored in `Application.Storage` with expiry timestamp
- On app start: check stored tokens → refresh if near expiry → re-login if refresh fails
- On 401 response: attempt refresh → re-login → show error if both fail

### Action Items

- [ ] **Wash:** Update C# test tool to validate `/user/login_pocket_casts` and correct `/user/token` format
- [ ] **Mal:** Update `PocketCastsService.mc` to store both tokens + expiry
- [ ] **Kaylee:** Plan `Application.Storage` keys for token persistence

### Documentation

- Updated `docs/pocketcasts-api-reference.md` with corrected auth documentation and examples

## Target Venu 4 41mm Only (2026-04-12)

**Author:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Scope:** Device targeting, UX specification, build configuration

### Context

YoCasts is Jarod's personal project. Previous manifest targeted 16 devices across Venu, Forerunner, Fenix, Vivoactive, and epix lines. For a single user with one watch, this multi-device support is unnecessary overhead.

### Decision

Target exclusively the **Garmin Venu 4 41mm** (`venu441mm`).

### Device Specifications

- 390×390 AMOLED round display (capacitive touch + 2 buttons)
- 768 KB watch app memory
- 54×54 px launcher icon
- Connect IQ SDK 4.2+

### Changes Made

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `YoCastsGarmin/manifest.xml` | Single `<iq:product>` entry: `venu441mm`. Bumped `minSdkVersion` to 4.2.0. |
| `YoCastsGarmin/monkey.jungle` | Added `base.device = venu441mm` build target. |
| `docs/garmin-ux-spec.md` | Rewrote §1 (Target Device) for single device. Updated input model to touch + 2-button. Updated Now Playing from 240×240 to 390×390. Updated memory budget from 128 KB to 768 KB. |

### Design Implications

- **Touch-first design** — touchscreen is primary input; buttons secondary
- **Memory-generous** — 768 KB available enables richer caching, larger lists, future artwork support
- **Modern SDK** — no backward-compatibility constraint, can use SDK 4.2+ APIs freely
- **Simplified testing** — one simulator device, one physical device to deploy to

### Impact

- **Mal (Architecture):** Can assume 768 KB memory budget for caching and feature design
- **Wash (API):** Device constraints confirmed; API surface targets align with Venu 4 specs
- **Team:** Single-device focus allows optimized UX instead of lowest-common-denominator design

### Verification

All files updated and internally consistent. Ready for development phase.

## User Directive: Venu 4 41mm Personal Watch (2026-04-12)

**Requestor:** Jarod Aerts  
**Timestamp:** 2026-04-12T00:56Z

The Garmin app should be built specifically for the Venu 4 41mm. This app is mainly just for Jarod, so it will pretty much only run on that watch. No need to support a wide range of devices.

---

## Garmin App MVP Scaffolding (2026-04-12)

**Author:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev)  
**Status:** Approved (implementation complete)

Created the full `YoCastsGarmin/` Connect IQ project with mock data service. The app has 5 screens, Menu2 navigation, and an `IPodcastService` interface that `MockPodcastService` implements. The mock data uses Dictionary keys matching PocketCasts API field names for easy swap to real service.

### Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Menu2 returned directly from `getInitialView()`** — no wrapper View for the home screen. Cleaner and avoids view stack issues.
2. **NowPlayingView uses delegate-holds-view-reference pattern** — delegate calls `setView()` to get a reference for controlling playback. This is the standard CIQ pattern since delegates can't access the view stack.
3. **Mock data normalizes the Up Next structure** — real API returns `{order: [...], episodes: {...}}` but mock uses a simple array. The real PocketCastsService should normalize this in its `getQueue()` method.
4. **No `static` functions used** — Monkey C supports them but they cause issues in some SDK versions. Instance methods throughout.
5. **`getInitialView()` has no explicit return type annotation** — SDK will reject override if typed.

### Impact

- **Mal (Architecture):** IPodcastService interface ready for service implementation. Dictionary models align with API response structure.
- **Zoe (Testing):** Fixtures available for UI logic testing without live API.
- **Team:** Scaffolding complete and ready for real API integration.

## Phase 1 Offline Caching — Decorator Pattern with Read-Through Cache (2026-04-12)

**Author:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Affects:** Mal (Lead), Wash (API Dev)

### Context

Mal's `docs/offline-sync-design.md` defines a 4-phase offline strategy. Phase 1 is metadata caching — enabling users to browse podcasts, episodes, and the queue even when the phone is out of range.

### What Was Built

1. **`CacheManager.mc` (module):** Wraps `Application.Storage` with typed save/load methods. Keys prefixed `"yc_"` to avoid collisions with future changelog/auth data. Every entry stores a `cachedAt` timestamp for TTL decisions. `clearCache()` calls `clearValues()` — safe in Phase 1 since auth lives in Properties.

2. **`CachedPodcastService.mc` (decorator):** Wraps any `IPodcastService` via constructor injection. Loads cached data on init for instant UI. Delegates `fetchAll()` only when `phoneConnected == true`. Read-through getters cache fresh data on each view cycle. TTLs: queue 5min, podcasts 30min, episodes 1hr.

3. **App wiring:** Real API mode: `CachedPodcastService(PocketCastsPodcastService(email, password))`. Mock mode: unwrapped `MockPodcastService()`.

### Design Decisions

1. **Module vs class for CacheManager** — Module chosen. No instance state; all functions operate on Storage directly.
2. **Read-through caching** — Async callbacks impractical to intercept. Getters check wrapped service each view cycle, cache when new data detected. `_refreshPending` flag prevents redundant writes.
3. **TTLs are revalidation hints, not expiry** — Per Mal's design: stale data always served, TTLs only trigger network refresh.
4. **`clearValues()` for `clearCache()`** — Phase 1 only. Must become selective when changelog/auth tokens are added.

### Impact on Future Phases

- **Phase 2 (Position Tracking):** `savePlaybackPosition()` / `loadPlaybackPosition()` already implemented. Phase 2 adds changelog key and calls from Now Playing view.
- **Phase 3 (Audio Download):** No impact — audio uses separate Media module storage.
- **Phase 4 (Reconciliation):** Sync engine reads/writes through CacheManager. Key prefixes keep caching separate from sync data.

### Open Questions

- Exact `Application.Storage` size limit on Venu 4 41mm — needs hardware testing.
- Whether `clearValues()` needs to become selective once changelog/auth keys are added.

## Architecture Assessment: Podcast Art + Audio Playback Roadmap (2026-04-16)

**By:** Mal (Lead)  
**Date:** 2026-04-16  
**Requested by:** Jarod Aerts  
**Status:** Assessment — pending team review  
**Affects:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev), Wash (API Dev), Zoe (Tests)

### Item 1: Podcast Art Colors + Thumbnails

#### Feasibility Verdict: **FEASIBLE — but defer to Phase E (polish)**

#### CIQ Image Capabilities

CIQ provides `Communications.makeImageRequest()` — a first-class API for downloading images over the network. It returns a `BitmapResource` in the callback.

**Key options:**
- `:maxWidth` / `:maxHeight` — resize on-transit
- `:packingFormat` — supports JPG, PNG, YUV (since API 4.2.0, Venu 4 qualifies)
- `:dithering` — Floyd-Steinberg for palette-limited rendering
- `:palette` — constrain to specific color palette

#### Recommended Thumbnail Size

- **40×40px** is the sweet spot for 390×390 watch screen
- Uncompressed: 40 × 40 × 2 bytes = **3,200 bytes per image**
- With JPG packing: ~1-2 KB per image over-the-wire
- **Do NOT exceed 48×48px**

#### Color Tinting Works

In custom `HomeMenuView` and custom list views, setting per-item backgrounds via `Dc.setColor()` and `Dc.fillRoundedRectangle()` is trivial. Menu2-based views (Queue, Episodes) are harder — would need custom `MenuItem` subclasses.

**Recommendation:** Color tinting on home screen pills and Podcasts list only. NOT on Menu2 lists.

#### Memory Impact Analysis

Storing 15 thumbnails + 15 color values simultaneously:

| Item | Per-podcast | × 15 podcasts |
|---|---|---|
| Thumbnail (40×40, 16-bit) | 3,200 B | **48,000 B** (~47 KB) |
| Color value (Number) | 4 B | 60 B |
| BitmapResource overhead | ~100 B | 1,500 B |
| **Total** | ~3,304 B | **~49,560 B** (~48 KB) |

**48 KB is 6.3% of 768 KB budget.** Manageable IF lazy-loaded.

**Critical constraint:** Load thumbnails for visible items only (3-5 on screen). Evict off-screen to drop peak memory to ~16 KB — acceptable.

#### Where to Extract Colors: **Proxy (server-side)**

On-device color extraction is not viable (no pixel API). Proxy should:
1. Fetch podcast's art URL from PocketCasts API
2. Download image server-side
3. Extract dominant color (k-means or simple average)
4. Return hex color in podcast metadata JSON (e.g., `"artColor": "#2A4B8D"`)
5. Optionally: serve resized thumbnail via separate endpoint

#### What We'd Need

| Component | Owner | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Proxy: `GET /art/{podcastUuid}` endpoint | Wash | 1 day |
| Proxy: Add `artColor` to `/user/podcast/list` | Wash | 0.5 day |
| Garmin: ArtworkManager module — lazy-load | Kaylee | 2 days |
| Garmin: Update custom list views | Kaylee | 1 day |
| Tests: Proxy art endpoint | Zoe | 0.5 day |
| **Total** | | **~5 days** |

#### Recommendation

**Defer to Phase E.** Rationale:
1. Audio download is the core feature — art is polish
2. 48 KB RAM may be needed for sync engine and download queue
3. No hard dependency — app works perfectly with text-only lists
4. Color extraction adds network dependency (failure mode)
5. When built: colors first → thumbnails second → per-item tinting last

### Item 2: Audio Download & Playback Roadmap

#### Current State

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| App type: AudioContentProviderApp | ✅ Migrated, builds clean |
| Dual-build (sim vs device) | ✅ Configured |
| Media stubs | ✅ In source/media/ |
| CacheManager + CachedPodcastService | ✅ Phase 1 complete |
| Real Venu 4 hardware | ❌ Not available yet |
| Simulator audio testing | ❌ CIQ limitation |

#### What We Can Build NOW (Simulator-Testable)

**Phases A and B** are pure data-layer and HTTP — no Media module, fully simulator-testable.

##### Phase A: Changelog & Position Tracking (2-3 days)

All six tasks simulator-safe:

| Task | Description | Testable in Sim? |
|---|---|---|
| A1: Changelog in CacheManager | Coalesced mutation log, selective `clearCache()` | ✅ Yes |
| A2: Positions Map | Consolidated positions, eviction, dirty tracking | ✅ Yes |
| A3: PositionTracker module | Timer-based position saves, battery-aware frequency | ✅ Yes |
| A4: ConnectivityManager | Three-state polling, transition callbacks | ✅ Partial |
| A5: CachedPodcastService update | Fix `_isConnected()` bug | ✅ Yes |
| A6: Auth token persistence | Save/load/refresh tokens in Storage | ✅ Yes |

##### Phase B: Sync Engine (4-5 days)

Entirely HTTP + Storage. No Media module.

| Task | Description | Testable in Sim? |
|---|---|---|
| B1: SyncEngine state machine | 7-step sync: auth → push → pull → reconcile → clean | ✅ Yes |
| B2: Push pipeline | Batch changelog entries to `/sync/update_episode` | ✅ Yes |
| B3: Pull pipeline | Fetch `/user/in_progress`, queue, episodes | ✅ Yes |
| B4: Reconciliation logic | "Furthest position wins", status hierarchy | ✅ Yes |
| B5: Auto-sync trigger | ConnectivityManager listener → triggerSync() | ✅ Yes |

#### What MUST Wait for Real Hardware

| Component | Why It Needs Hardware | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| SyncDelegate downloads | `HTTP_RESPONSE_CONTENT_TYPE_AUDIO` + Media cache | Phase C |
| ContentIterator | Needs `Media.getCachedContentObj()` | Phase D |
| ContentDelegate callbacks | Fired by native media player only | Phase D |
| Bluetooth audio output | Hardware-only | Phase D |
| Media.getCacheStatistics() | Real values only on device | Phase C |
| Wi-Fi direct detection (reliable) | Sim doesn't model `phoneConnected` vs `connectionAvailable` | Phase A (partial) |

#### Prioritized Work Breakdown

**Priority: Phase A → Phase B → Download Queue UI → Phase C (hardware)**

Sprint 1 Foundation (Week 1): 11 tasks (6 days)
Sprint 2 Sync Engine (Week 2): 8 tasks (5 days)
Sprint 3 Download Queue UI (Week 3): 7 tasks (5 days)

Total: ~3 weeks, all simulator-testable except Phase C/D components.

#### Key Risks

1. **`makeWebRequest()` with `HTTP_RESPONSE_CONTENT_TYPE_AUDIO` unverified on Venu 4** — same mechanism Spotify/Deezer use. Mitigated by sample verification.

2. **PocketCasts audio URLs may require auth or redirect** — validate during Sprint 1. If auth needed, proxy must be authenticated intermediary.

3. **64 KB background memory for SyncDelegate** — ~15 KB usable after Garmin overhead. Keep delegate lean.

4. **No download resume in v1** — full re-download on failure. Acceptable for 20-50 MB episodes on Wi-Fi.

#### Recommendation

**Start Sprints 1-3 immediately.** Everything is simulator-testable. By the time Venu 4 arrives, we'll have complete data layer and download code written — waiting for hardware validation only.

**Highest-risk unknown:** Task 7 (audio URL resolution). Wash prioritize this — if PocketCasts audio requires special auth, we need to know early.

### Summary of Calls

| Decision | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Podcast art colors + thumbnails | **Feasible. Defer to Phase E.** Colors first, thumbnails second. Server-side extraction. |
| Audio download — what to build now | **Phases A + B + download queue UI.** All simulator-testable. ~3 weeks. |
| Audio download — what waits | **Phases C + D.** Needs Venu 4 hardware. |
| Highest priority task | **A1 (changelog), audio URL resolution for Wash, tests for Zoe.** |
| Highest risk | **PocketCasts audio URL auth — Wash validates first.** |

## Podcast Art Color & Thumbnail Feasibility — Artwork is GO (2026-04-16)

**By:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-04-16  
**Affects:** Mal (Lead), Wash (API Dev), Jarod Aerts

### Summary

Completed full API research on CIQ image loading and custom colors. **Both are feasible on Venu 4 41mm.**

### Key Findings

1. **`makeImageRequest()`** loads PNG/JPG from URLs at runtime. 30×30px JPG = 1-3 KB per image, well under 32 KB response limit.

2. **768 KB memory** on Venu 4 means 15 thumbnails at 30×30px = ~27 KB (16-bit), trivially within budget. The "no artwork in v1" decision was based on 128 KB devices — no longer applicable for Venu 4-only build.

3. **Custom hex colors** like `0xFF5500` work directly in `dc.setColor()`. `Graphics.createColor(alpha, r, g, b)` enables semi-transparent overlays.

4. **`CustomMenuItem`** (API 3.2.0+) or custom View can render per-item brand-color backgrounds and thumbnails.

### Recommendation

**Option A — brand colors first.** Highest visual impact for zero cost. Defer thumbnails to Phase E.

### Impact on Proxy

Wash: proxy already whitelists `artwork_url` and `author_color`. If `author_color` comes as hex string, consider pre-parsing to integer for watch efficiency.

## Design: Podcast Art Color & Thumbnail Support (2026-04-16)

**By:** Wash (API Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-04-16  
**Affects:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev), Mal (Lead), Jarod Aerts  
**Status:** Proposal — needs team review

### Executive Summary

PocketCasts already provides pre-computed color metadata and server-side resized artwork. **No image processing library is needed.** The proxy enriches the podcast list with colors by fetching a lightweight JSON endpoint. Thumbnails load natively via CIQ's `makeImageRequest()`.

### Research Findings

#### 1. PocketCasts Art URLs — Confirmed

Artwork served from `static.pocketcasts.com` as WebP only:

| URL Pattern | Status | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `/discover/images/webp/200/{uuid}.webp` | ✅ Working | ~3.1 KB |
| `/discover/images/webp/480/{uuid}.webp` | ✅ Working | ~7.1 KB |
| `/discover/images/webp/960/{uuid}.webp` | ✅ Working | ~14.7 KB |

No authentication required. Cache: `max-age=604800` (7 days), ETag supported.

#### 2. PocketCasts Color Metadata — The Goldmine

PocketCasts pre-computes dominant colors for every podcast:

```
GET https://static.pocketcasts.com/discover/images/metadata/{uuid}.json
```

Returns (231 bytes, no auth, 7-day cache):

```json
{
  "colors": {
    "background": "#1d2b38",
    "tintForDarkBg": "#eaefa9",
    "tintForLightBg": "#257bbb",
    "fabForLightBg": "#61c6c7",
    "fabForDarkBg": "#61c6c7",
    "linkForLightBg": "#61c6c7",
    "linkForDarkBg": "#61c6c7"
  }
}
```

Eliminates need for SkiaSharp, ImageSharp, or custom color extraction. **Tested with multiple UUIDs — all return valid colors.**

#### 3. Image Processing Libraries — NOT NEEDED

| Library | Azure Fit | Cold Start | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SkiaSharp** | ⚠️ Needs native libs | +200-500ms | ~25 MB, unsupported on Linux consumption |
| **ImageSharp** | ✅ Pure .NET | +50-100ms | ~5 MB, best choice if needed |
| **System.Drawing** | ❌ Not supported | N/A | GDI+ unsupported on Azure |

#### 4. Size Budget Analysis

| Approach | Per-podcast | 15 podcasts | Under 32 KB? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Color hex only (`artColor`) | ~7 bytes | ~105 bytes | ✅ Trivial |
| Color + artUrl | ~75 bytes | ~1.1 KB | ✅ Easy |
| Base64 40×40 JPEG | ~1,500 bytes | **~22.5 KB** | ⚠️ Tight |

Current stripped list: ~3-5 KB for 15. Colors add negligible overhead.

#### 5. CIQ `makeImageRequest()` — Native Solution

```monkey-c
Communications.makeImageRequest(
    "https://static.pocketcasts.com/discover/images/webp/200/" + uuid + ".webp",
    {},
    { :maxWidth => 48, :maxHeight => 48 },
    method(:onArtReceived)
);
```

**Key properties:**
- Native image decoding (PNG, JPEG, BMP, WebP varies)
- Automatic resizing via `:maxWidth`/`:maxHeight`
- Returns `BitmapResource` directly usable in views
- Async callback — fits CIQ's event model
- Memory: 48×48 ARGB = ~9.2 KB per image

### Recommended Design: Option C (Initial) → Option A (Phase E)

#### Immediate (Phase E prep)

**Proxy changes:**
1. When handling `/user/podcast/list`, fetch color metadata for each podcast UUID
2. Add `artColor` (background hex) and `artTint` to each podcast
3. In-memory cache with 7-day TTL, matching PocketCasts cache headers

**CIQ changes:**
1. Read `artColor` from podcast data — use as background tint
2. Prepare for `artUrl` loading later

#### Proxy Implementation Sketch

```csharp
private static readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, ArtMetadata> _artCache = new();

private async Task<string> EnrichPodcastList(string json)
{
    var doc = JsonNode.Parse(json);
    if (doc is not JsonObject root) return json;
    
    var podcasts = root["podcasts"]?.AsArray();
    if (podcasts == null) return json;
    
    var colorTasks = new List<Task>();
    foreach (var podcast in podcasts)
    {
        if (podcast is not JsonObject podObj) continue;
        var uuid = podObj["uuid"]?.GetValue<string>();
        if (uuid == null) continue;
        
        colorTasks.Add(Task.Run(async () =>
        {
            var colors = await GetArtColors(uuid);
            if (colors != null)
            {
                podObj["artColor"] = colors.Background;
                podObj["artTint"] = colors.Tint;
            }
        }));
    }
    
    await Task.WhenAll(colorTasks);
    return root.ToJsonString();
}
```

#### Caching Strategy (v1)

**In-Memory Cache:**
- **Pros:** Zero latency after cold start, zero cost
- **Cons:** Lost on cold start, first request pays ~100-150ms for 15 parallel fetches
- **Mitigation:** PocketCasts metadata endpoint is fast (~50ms), parallelized
- **Cold start impact:** ~100-150ms on initial `/user/podcast/list` call

### Impact Assessment

| Concern | Impact |
|---|---|
| Response size | +1.8 KB for 15 podcasts. Still ~5-7 KB total, under 32 KB |
| Proxy latency | +100-150ms on cold start. ~0ms on warm requests |
| Cold start time | No new NuGet packages. No change. |
| CIQ memory | 48×48 bitmap = ~9.2 KB. 15 loaded = ~138 KB. Within budget. |
| Azure cost | $0.00 — metadata from PocketCasts CDN |

### Open Questions for Team

1. **Kaylee:** Does `makeImageRequest()` support WebP on Venu 4 41mm SDK 9.1.0? If not, need proxy-side PNG conversion (Option B).
2. **Kaylee:** Target thumbnail size for Menu2 items? UX spec mentions 48×48 — confirm?
3. **Mal:** Option C now (colors only) or jump to Option A (colors + URLs)? Option C aligns with "no artwork in v1."
4. **All:** Include `tintForDarkBg` for text accent colors?

### Recommendation

**Implement Option C now (colors only), prepare for Option A later.**

1. Add `artColor` and `artTint` to proxy response — ~15 lines of code
2. Zero new dependencies, zero cold start impact
3. CIQ uses colors for tinted UI immediately
4. Phase E: add `artUrl` and `makeImageRequest()` handling
5. If WebP unsupported: add conversion endpoint (Option B) at that time

**Key insight: PocketCasts already did the hard work.** We forward their metadata, no image processing needed.

## Download Data Layer — Storage-Backed Queue + Proxy Audio Info (2026-04-16)

**By:** Wash (API Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-04-16  
**Affects:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev), Mal (Lead)

### What Was Built

Three components forming the data layer for episode audio downloads (Phase B/C):

#### 1. DownloadQueue Module (Garmin)

**File:** `YoCastsGarmin/source/services/DownloadQueue.mc`

Replaced mock stub with real Application.Storage persistence. Queue survives app restarts.

**Design:**
- Storage key: `yc_dl_queue` — array of download item dictionaries
- Max queue size: 20 episodes
- Status flow: PENDING → DOWNLOADING → DOWNLOADED or FAILED
- Retry policy: Failed items retry up to 3 times, then ignored by `getNextPending()`
- Backward compatible: All existing constants (DL_UUID, DL_STATUS, etc.) and methods preserved

#### 2. StorageManager Module (Garmin)

**File:** `YoCastsGarmin/source/services/StorageManager.mc`

Tracks downloaded episode metadata separately from Media module.

**Design:**
- Storage key: `yc_downloads` — dictionary mapping episodeUuid → metadata
- No Media imports — works in simulator (source/media/ excluded)
- `refId` field: Will hold Media.ContentRef on hardware, string placeholder now
- `getTotalDownloadSize()`: Enforce storage budget

#### 3. AudioInfo Proxy Endpoint (Azure)

**File:** `YoCastsProxy/AudioInfoProxy.cs`

New endpoint: `GET /api/pocketcasts/episode/{uuid}/audio-info`

**Features:**
- Fetches episode metadata from PocketCasts (audio URL, duration, title)
- Issues HEAD request to CDN for real file size (API `size` field unreliable)
- Returns final URL after redirect chain resolution
- 15-second timeout on HEAD requests
- Watch uses this to check storage before downloading

### Decisions Made

1. **DownloadQueue owns UI contract** — DL_* constants and methods preserved for DownloadsView compatibility
2. **StorageManager separate from DownloadQueue** — queue tracks intent (what to download), storage tracks outcome (what's downloaded)
3. **No Media module references** — both modules compile in simulator build
4. **HEAD-based size resolution in proxy** — Garmin's `makeWebRequest()` doesn't support HEAD. Proxy does HEAD and returns size in JSON

### Build Status

✅ Garmin simulator build passes  
✅ All existing tests pass  
⚠️ Proxy deployment pending (`func azure functionapp publish`)

### What's Next

- **Phase C4 (Kaylee):** Wire `YoCastsSyncDelegate` to use `DownloadQueue.getNextPending()` and `StorageManager.markDownloaded()`
- **Phase D:** ContentIterator reads from StorageManager to enumerate downloaded episodes
- **Proxy deployment:** AudioInfoProxy needs publish to go live

## Download UI Architecture & DownloadQueue Interface Contract (2026-04-16)

**By:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-04-16  
**Affects:** Wash (API Dev), Mal (Lead)

### Summary

Implemented download management UI screens with DownloadQueue module. Interface contract defined and ready for Wash's real implementation.

### Decisions Made

#### 1. DownloadQueue Module Interface

Module-level singleton pattern with in-memory state. Real implementation persists to `Application.Storage`.

**Module functions:**
- `addToQueue(episodeDict)` — append to queue
- `removeFromQueue(uuid)` — remove by UUID
- `getStatus(uuid)` — query current state
- `getProgress(uuid)` — get percent complete
- `getDownloads()` — return all download items
- `getDownloadCount()` — count pending+downloading
- `getNextPending()` — get next queued episode for SyncDelegate
- `markDownloading(uuid)` — update status
- `markDownloaded(uuid, refId)` — mark complete with Media ref
- `toEpisodeDict()` — convert for NowPlayingView compatibility

#### 2. Download Status Constants

Four states: `STATUS_PENDING (0)`, `STATUS_DOWNLOADING (1)`, `STATUS_DOWNLOADED (2)`, `STATUS_FAILED (3)`

#### 3. Episode Action Menu Pattern

EpisodeListView shows Menu2 action popup on episode select:
- Play (existing — navigates to NowPlayingView)
- Download (new — calls `DownloadQueue.addToQueue()`)

Extensible for future actions (Star, Mark Played, etc.).

#### 4. Downloads Pill Placement

Added between Podcasts and Settings in HomeMenuView:
- Queue → Podcasts → Downloads → Settings
- TOTAL_MENU_HEIGHT: 382 → 478px
- Touch zone: Y < 260 for scrollable area

#### 5. Download Item Dictionary Keys

Separate from DataKeys.E_* to avoid coupling:
- `DL_UUID`, `DL_TITLE`, `DL_PODCAST_TITLE`, `DL_STATUS`, `DL_PROGRESS`, `DL_SIZE`, `DL_STATUS_TEXT`

`toEpisodeDict()` converts for NowPlayingView compatibility.

### Open Questions Resolved

- **Failed downloads auto-retry:** Yes, up to 3 times per Wash's implementation
- **Maximum downloads:** Capped at 20 episodes or storage budget
- **Sort order:** By status (downloading first) then by add order

### Build Status

✅ Simulator build passes  
✅ Device build passes (Venu 4 41mm)  
✅ Strict linting enabled (`-l 3`)  

### What's Next

- **Wash (DownloadQueue real impl):** Persist to `Application.Storage`, implement queue state machine
- **Kaylee (Phase C):** Wire SyncDelegate to use `DownloadQueue.getNextPending()` for actual downloads

## YoCastsProxy: Art Colors + Audio Info Deployed to Azure (2026-04-16)

**By:** Wash (API Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-04-16  
**Status:** DEPLOYED

### Summary

Extended YoCastsProxy to enrich podcast metadata with brand colors, tints, and artwork URLs. Also added audio metadata endpoint for download planning.

### Deployed URL

```
https://yocasts-proxy.azurewebsites.net/api/pocketcasts/{*path}
```

### Changes Made

#### 1. Podcast List Enrichment

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/pocketcasts/user/podcast/list`

**Added fields per podcast:**
- `artColor` — background hex (e.g., `#1d2b38`)
- `artTint` — tint for dark backgrounds (e.g., `#eaefa9`)
- `artUrl` — 200px WebP image URL (not yet loaded by watch, prepared for Phase E)

**Implementation:**
- Parallel fetch of color metadata for each podcast UUID
- Source: `https://static.pocketcasts.com/discover/images/metadata/{uuid}.json`
- In-memory cache with 7-day TTL (matching PocketCasts headers)
- `ConcurrentDictionary<string, ArtMetadata>` storage

#### 2. Audio Info Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/pocketcasts/episode/{uuid}/audio-info`

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "audioUrl": "https://...",
  "duration": 3600,
  "fileSize": 52428800,
  "title": "Episode Title"
}
```

**Features:**
- Fetches episode metadata from PocketCasts
- Issues HEAD request to CDN for real file size (API field unreliable)
- Follows redirect chain to final CDN URL
- 15-second timeout on slow CDNs
- Watch uses this before downloading to verify storage availability

### Implementation Details

**File:** `YoCastsProxy/PocketCastsProxy.cs`

- **Color fetch strategy:** Parallel Task.WhenAll() for 15 UUIDs
- **Fallback:** If color fetch fails, podcast returned unchanged (graceful degradation)
- **Response size:** +1.8 KB for 15 podcasts (still ~5-7 KB total, under 32 KB limit)
- **Dependencies:** Zero new NuGet packages — uses existing System.Text.Json
- **Latency:** ~100-150ms cold start, ~0ms warm cache
- **Cost:** Free — metadata fetched from PocketCasts CDN

### Deployment Verification

✅ HTTP 401 on unauthenticated `/user/podcast/list` (correct — Bearer token required)  
✅ Color metadata fetches successfully for all podcasts  
✅ Response size within budget  
✅ Endpoint available at: `https://yocasts-proxy.azurewebsites.net/api/pocketcasts/user/podcast/list`

### Caching Strategy (v1 — In-Memory)

**Pros:**
- Zero latency after cold start
- Zero cost
- Simple implementation

**Cons:**
- Lost on cold start
- First request pays ~100-150ms for parallel metadata fetches

**Mitigation:** PocketCasts metadata endpoint is fast (~50ms per request). Total cold start impact: ~100-150ms on initial podcast list fetch.

**Future (v2):** If cold start latency becomes a problem, migrate to Azure Table Storage persistence (eliminates cold start penalty, costs ~$0.001/month).

### Action Items for Team

- **Kaylee:** Update Garmin app to read `artColor`/`artTint` from proxy and use for UI tinting
- **Kaylee:** Prepare for `artUrl` loading via `makeImageRequest()` in Phase E
- **Mal:** Verify CachedPodcastService routes through proxy URL
- **Zoe:** Add tests for color metadata endpoint

### Open Questions

1. **Kaylee:** Does `makeImageRequest()` support WebP on Venu 4 SDK 9.1.0? If not, proxy may need PNG conversion endpoint.
2. **Team:** Should we implement in-memory OR Table Storage caching for v1? Current choice: in-memory (simpler, cold start trade-off acceptable).

## PowerShell Deploy Script: deploy-sim.ps1 Conversion (2026-04-19)

**By:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-04-19  
**Affects:** Jarod Aerts, all agents running builds

### Decision

Created `YoCastsGarmin/deploy-sim.ps1` — a PowerShell rewrite of `deploy-sim.bat` with automatic simulator launch.

### Key Changes

1. **Auto-start simulator** — Checks for running `simulator` process; launches `simulator.exe` from SDK bin with 5s init wait if absent. No more "is the simulator running?" failures.
2. **Idiomatic PowerShell** — Uses `$ErrorActionPreference`, `$LASTEXITCODE`, `Write-Host` with colors, `Start-Process` for the simulator.
3. **Old .bat preserved** — `deploy-sim.bat` still works if anyone prefers it.

### Recommendation

Use `.\deploy-sim.ps1` as the default build+deploy command going forward. Update any docs referencing `deploy-sim.bat` to mention both options.

## Phase C Audio Download Implementation — SyncDelegate & ContentIterator (2026-04-19)

**By:** Kaylee (Garmin Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-04-19  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Affects:** Wash (API Dev), Mal (Lead), Zoe (Tester)

### Context

Phase C implements the core audio download pipeline — the SyncDelegate that runs in background when the watch is on charger+WiFi, and the ContentIterator that feeds downloaded episodes to the native Garmin media player.

### Decisions Made

#### 1. PersistedContent.Iterator for Audio Downloads
`makeWebRequest` with `HTTP_RESPONSE_CONTENT_TYPE_AUDIO` returns `PersistedContent.Iterator`, not `Media.ContentRef` directly. We call `iter.next()` to extract the ContentRef. This required adding `PersistedContent` permission to manifest.xml.

#### 2. Background Token Management
The SyncDelegate authenticates independently by reading PocketCasts email/password from `Application.Properties` and caching the token in `Application.Storage` (keys: `yc_bg_token`, `yc_bg_token_exp`). Token is reused across sync cycles with 5-minute expiry buffer.

#### 3. Sequential Downloads Only
One episode at a time within the 64KB background memory limit. After each download completes (or fails), we move to the next pending item. Failed downloads get up to 3 retry attempts across sync cycles.

#### 4. Cancel-Safe Design
`onStopSync()` resets in-progress downloads to PENDING status so they retry on the next sync cycle. No partial state is left behind.

#### 5. StorageManager Cleanup on UI Remove
Added `StorageManager.removeDownload(uuid)` call in DownloadsView when removing episodes, ensuring both the queue entry AND the persisted content metadata are cleaned up.

### Files Changed

- `YoCastsGarmin/manifest.xml` — Added Background, PersistedContent permissions
- `YoCastsGarmin/source/media/YoCastsSyncDelegate.mc` — Full implementation (~300 lines)
- `YoCastsGarmin/source/media/YoCastsContentIterator.mc` — Full implementation (~125 lines)
- `YoCastsGarmin/source/views/DownloadsView.mc` — StorageManager cleanup on remove
- `YoCastsGarmin/source/sim/LocalCredentials.mc` — Created stub for simulator build

### Build Verification

- ✅ Device build passes (default type check level)
- ✅ Simulator build passes (media/ excluded from sim build)

### Technical Findings

**PersistedContent.Iterator Pattern:**  
`makeWebRequest(options)` with `HTTP_RESPONSE_CONTENT_TYPE_AUDIO` returns `PersistedContent.Iterator`.  
Call `iter.next()` to extract `Media.ContentRef`.  
Requires `PersistedContent` permission in manifest.

### Open Items for Hardware Testing

- ContentRef ID type: stored as String via `.toString()`. May need exact type if constructor expects Number.
- 64KB memory limit: cannot validate in simulator, requires real Venu 4 hardware.
- `mediaEncoding` option: not set in makeWebRequest — system should auto-detect from HTTP Content-Type. May need explicit `Media.ENCODING_MP3` if hardware testing reveals issues.

### Impact

Phase C audio download pipeline complete and ready for hardware integration testing. Prerequisite: Background permission + Venu 4 hardware (Mal's gating conditions met). No additional API changes needed from Wash — proxy already provides audio URLs.
